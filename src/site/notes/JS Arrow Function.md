# JS Array Function

Another way to create a function and assign it to a variable (this process is called [[JS Arrow Function#Function Expression\|#Function Expression]]) is called **arrow function**, which is similar to [[Python Lambda Function\|Python Lambda Function]]

```js
let myFun = (para1, para2) => expression
```

This creates a function `myFun` that accepts arguments `para1` and `para2`, then evaluates the `expression` on the right side with their use and **returns its result**.

In other words, itâ€™s the shorter version of the [[JS Arrow Function#Function Expression\|#Function Expression]]:

```js
let myFun = function(para1, para2) {
  return expression;
};
```

* If we have only one parameter, then parentheses around parameters can be omitted
    - <span class="alt-check alt-check-impt">This gives the simplest form of a function: `para => expression`</span>
* If there are no parameters, parentheses will be empty (but they should be present)
* For more complex expressions, like multiple expressions or statements, we should enclose them in curly braces `{}`, then use a normal `return` within them
