# Q-Q Plot

A **Q–Q plot (quantile-quantile plot)** is a probability plot, a **graphical method** for **comparing two probability distributions** by plotting their **quantiles** against each other. A point $(x, y)$ on the plot corresponds to one of the quantiles of the second distribution (y-coordinate) plotted against the same quantile of the first distribution (x-coordinate).

> [!ex] Quartile-Quartile Plot
> For example, when using quartiles as the only quantiles, there are only five points on a graph, representing (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) respectively.

If the two distributions being compared are similar, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on the **identity line $y = x$**. If the distributions are linearly related, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on a line, but not necessarily on the line $y = x$. Q–Q plots can also be used as a graphical means of estimating parameters in a location-scale family of distributions.

Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model. For example, collected data and a [[Normal Distribution\|Normal Distribution]].
Q–Q plots can also be used to compare collections of data, which can be viewed as a **non-parametric** approach to comparing their underlying distributions. A Q–Q plot is generally more diagnostic than comparing the samples' [[Histogram\|Histogram]]s, but is less widely known.

Since Q–Q plots compare distributions, there is no need for the values to be observed as pairs, as in a scatter plot, or even for the numbers of values in the two groups being compared to be equal.

## Q-Q Line

A Q-Q line is a line connecting the two points at specified quartiles of the two distributions. The default quartiles are the first and the third.

## R Plot

```r
x <- rexp(1000, rate = 1) # exponential distribution
# built-in function
qqnorm(x)

# DIY
n <- rnorm(1000) # normal distribution
qx <- quantile(x, probs=seq(0,1,.001))
qn <- quantile(n, probs=seq(0,1,.001))
plot(qn,qx)
```
