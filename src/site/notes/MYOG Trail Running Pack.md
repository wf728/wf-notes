[[ðŸ“˜ MYOG\|ðŸ“˜ MYOG]]

In summer 2022 I built this running pack. My old pack was getting a bit beat-up and I never really liked the way it fit. Is this one perfect? Well maybe not quite, but it's fairly comfy and should last.

## Specs

* Weight - approx 9 oz
* Materials - Blue is Robic Nylon 100d from Ripstop By The Roll. Black is stretchy power mesh from Joann's (always doubled up!!) and white is a utility mesh, also from Joann's.
* Capacity - Approx 12 L main compartment, plus a generous back pocket and small side pockets. This is a little bigger than I meant to make it, but it'll be great for big mountain days.

## Features

* Vest-style wraparound straps. Adjustable where attached to pack.
* Generous vest strap pockets for water flasks, phone, snacks, permits, and other things.
