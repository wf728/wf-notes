# tidyr

Principles of tidy data:

- Every column is a variable
- Every row is an observation
- Every cell is a single value

An example:

The code for this example using package `tidyr` is

```r
tidydata <- messydata %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = !id, names_to = "roadtype", values_to = "mpg")
```

> `pivot_longer()` "lengthens" data, increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns. The inverse transformation  is `pivot_wider()`

As we can see, the `id` column is essential. Sometimes data have row names, but don't have a column name for them. Then we can create one manually

```r
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>%
    rownames_to_column("carname") %>%
    head()
```

- <span class="alt-check alt-check-tip">"Tidy" or "messy" depends on the use case. Sometimes, "tidy" data can be "messy" in other scenarios.</span>
