# Bar Chart

A bar chart is a chart or graph that presents [[EDAV - Categorical Data\|EDAV - Categorical Data]] with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a **column chart**.
One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value.
Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one, showing the values of more than one measured variable.

- For unbinned data, use `geom_bar` in [[ggplot2\|ggplot2]]
- For binned data, use `geom_col` in [[ggplot2\|ggplot2]]
- We can use `geom_text` to put labels directly in/on bars
- <span class="alt-check alt-check-rmk">Do not color bars when it is not necessary. Colors are needed [[Bar Chart#For Multivariate Categorical Data\|#For Multivariate Categorical Data]].</span>

## Ordering

There are [[EDAV - Categorical Data#Ordinal vs Nominal\|two typical scales]] of a categorical variable.
For ordinal data, sort bars in the logical order of the categories. For example, novice -> advanced -> expert.
You can sort in either direction top <-> bottom, or left -> right).
For nomial data, sort bars from **highest to lowest** (top -> bottom, left -> right).

## Rebinning

When plotting bar plots, rows ~~of different categories~~ in the same category are automatically stacked up.
However, when coloring, stacked bars are colored separately.
To bin the data by hand, we can use [[dplyr#summarise()\|dplyr#summarise()]] with `group_by(category)`.

```r
df %>%
  group_by(Class) %>%
  summarize(Freq = sum(Freq)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(Class, Freq, .desc = TRUE), Freq)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab("")
```

## For Multivariate Categorical Data

For [[EDAV - Multivariate Categorical Data\|Multivariate Categorical Data]], instead of drawing multiple bar charts (possible with facets), we can put bars for different categories *together* by

- Stacked Bar Chart
    - Better for the overall value
- Grouped Bar Chart
    - Better for the individual value

- <span class="alt-check alt-check-tip">Grouped bar charts are less used but more recommended</span>

## Likert Data

Likert data is a special categorical data that uses a **psychometric scale** commonly involved in questionnaires. For example

- strongly agree
- agree
- donâ€™t know
- disagree
- strongly disagree

Relative frequency stacked [[Bar Chart\|Bar Chart]]s are used to present this kind of data.

Colors play an important role in presenting this kind of data: we use a neutral color to present a neutral category, and use two different sets of colors for categories on two sides.

Another type of [[Bar Chart\|Bar Chart]], **diverging stacked bar chart**s, sometimes are more suitable. They align bars with the neutral category always in the center. By doing this, the inclination stands out. ^99cd33

Furthermore, we can separate and even remove the neutral category.
