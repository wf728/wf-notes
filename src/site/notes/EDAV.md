    - *Healthy* data
        - no wrong data
    - *good-shape* data

- Final project tips
    - The most important part: the result
    - Do not use other libraries when using [[D3]]
    - Use raw [[HTML]] in RMarkdown like it is in the `<body>` section
- Share D3 Online
    - <span class="alt-check alt-check-tip">there are advantages to an online setup, for example, not having to set up a local server as described in the chapter on reading files.</span>
    - [VizHub](https://vizhub.com/): host [[D3]] visualizations online
    - [[R Package - Bookdown|Bookdown]]: include D3 code directly in a bookdown book hosted online
        - [+] everyone is in one document
        - [-] the book must be knit to view the HTML which happens quickly without R code but is still an extra step
        - Workflows
            - Include everything in the `Rmd` files using raw [[HTML]] code
            - Put [[D3]] code in a separate `js` file, and then include it using `<script>` tag
                - remember to include the link to the [[D3]] library first
                - you can then create an identical `html` file for testing purposes only rather than render the full bookdown book each time you would like to observe changes to your D3 code
            - Put the entire visualization ([[HTML]] and [[D3]] code) in a separate `html` file, and then include it using `<iframe>` tag
    - [Observable](https://observablehq.com): official D3 web tool for creating and sharing D3 code
- [[D3 Axes]]
- [[JS Type - Array]]
- [[JS Function - map]]
- [[D3 Functions]]
- [[D3 Interactivity]]
- [[D3 Transition]]
