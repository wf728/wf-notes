# Machine Learning

## Definition

Machine Learning
: A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$
- [r] Michell, *Machine Learning* 1997

- <span class="alt-check alt-check-rmk">From a scientific and philosophical point of view,  machine learning is interesting because developing our understanding of machine learning entails developing our understanding of the **principles that underlie intelligence**</span>

### Task *T*

ML tasks are usually described in terms of how the ML system should **process an ==example==**.

An example is a collection of **==features==** that have been **quantitatively measured** from some object or event that we want the ML system to process. We typically represent an example as a vector $x âˆˆ \mathbb{R}^n$ where each entry $x_i$ of the vector is an **feature**.

- <span class="alt-check alt-check-ex">The features of an image are usually the values of the pixels in the image.</span>

Most common ML tasks:

* **Classification**
* **Classification with missing inputs**
    * When some of the inputs may be missing, the learning algorithm must learn a **set** of functions, each corresponding to classifying *x* with a different subset of its inputs missing
    * With *n* input variables, we can now obtain all *2^n^* different classification functions needed for each possible set of missing inputs, but we only need to learn a single function describing the joint probability distribution
* **Regression**
* **Structured output**
    * **Transcription**
    * **Machine translation**
* **Anomaly detection**
* **Synthesis and sampling**
* **Imputation of missing values**
* **Denoising**
* **Density estimation** or **probability mass function estimation**
    * Probability distribution estimated can be used to solve other tasks, such as the **missing value imputation** task

### Performance Measure *P*

In order to **evaluate the abilities** of a machine learning algorithm, we must design a **quantitative measure** of its performance. Usually this performance measure *P* is specific to the [task *T*](#task-t) being carried out by the system.

Most common performance measures:

* **Accuracy** or **error rate**: classification, structured output
* **average log-probability** (i.e. [[Cross-Entropy\|Cross-Entropy]]) the model assigns to some examples: density estimation

Usually we are interested in how well the machine learning algorithm performs on data that it has not seen before. We therefore evaluate these performance measures using a **==test set==** of data that is separate from the data used for training the machine learning system.

### Experience *E*

The experience of most ML algorithms is the **==dataset==**, a collection of many examples/data points, and an example is a collection of features.

ML algorithms can be broadly categorized as [[Unsupervised Learning\|Unsupervised Learning]] or [[Supervised Learning\|Supervised Learning]] by what kind of experience they are allowed to have during the learning process.

* [[Unsupervised Learning\|Unsupervised Learning]]
    * learn useful properties of the structure of this dataset
    * Examples: density estimation, synthesis, denoising, clustering
* [[Supervised Learning\|Supervised Learning]]
    * each example is also associated with a **label**/**target**
    * Example: classification, regression, structured output
* [[Semi-Supervised Learning\|Semi-Supervised Learning]]

### Describing a Dataset

* Matrix - a different example in each row, a different feature in each column
    * Requires that every example has the same features vectors of the same size
    * With a **label vector** in SL
* Set - examples as elements
