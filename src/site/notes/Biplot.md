# Biplot

- A biplot is a generalization of the simple two-variable [[Scatterplot\|Scatterplot]]
- A biplot overlays a **score plot** with a **loading plot**
    - This allows displaying information on both samples and variables
    - Samples are displayed as points
    - while variables are displayed either as
        - vectors,
        - linear axes
        - or nonlinear trajectories
- In the case of categorical variables, category level points may be used to represent the levels of a categorical variable. A generalized biplot displays information on both continuous and categorical variables.

> [!rmk] Axis Positions

## Loading Plot

We can use dimension-reduction methods to select or form two main variables, then *project* other selected/formed variables to the plane (make them linear combinations of the two main variables).

For example, using [[Principal Components Analysis\|Principal Components Analysis]], we can choose PC1 and PC2 as the two axes, and project original variables to the plane as vectors.

As [[Principal Components Analysis\|PCA]] theory suggests, the first PCs should have wider angles, meaning they have higher variance. Therefore, two vectors with a small angle (or near 180 degrees) have a high correlation; and two vectors that are near perpendicular have a small correlation. We can also compare a loading plot with a [[Scatterplot Matrix\|Scatterplot Matrix]] to verify this property.

## Score Plot

In [[Principal Components Analysis\|PCA]], transformed data is called PC scores. Similarly, score plots present transformed samples. A biplot combines a loading plot and a score plot.

## Elements

- Calibrated axis
    - We can draw ticks on loading vectors
- Projection Lines
    - We can project PC scores to vector lines
    - to see how samples scale on certain variables

## Implementation

- [redav](https://github.com/jtr13/redav)
    - Install: `remotes::install_github("jtr13/redav")`
    - Use `draw_biplot()`
        - option `key_axis` for calibrated axis and projection lines to it
            - option `project = FALSE` to disable the projection lines
