# Continuous Variable

A **continuous variable** can in theory take any value over its range, as opposed to a **discrete variable**.

- <span class="alt-check alt-check-tip">The real world is discrete: in practice data for continuous variables are generally **rounded** to some level of measurement accuracy.</span>

## Features of Continuous Variables

- **Asymmetry**
    - the distribution may not be symmetric like [[Normal Distribution\|Normal Distribution]]
    - the distribution may be skewed to the left or right
        - A distribution is called skewed **left/negative** if, as in the distribution graph, the left tail (smaller values) is much longer than the right tail (larger values)
        - A distribution is called skewed **right/positive** if, as in the distribution graph, the right tail (larger values) is much longer than the left tail (smaller values)

    - <span class="alt-check alt-check-ex">distributions of income</span>
- **Outliers**
    - there may be data far from the rest of the data
- **Multimodality**
    - the distribution may have more than one peak
    - the ==mode== is the value that appears most often in a set of data values
        - For a discrete [[Random Variable\|Random Variable]], the mode is $\argmax_{k}P(X=k)$
        - For a continuous [[Random Variable\|Random Variable]], the mode is the local maxima of the [[Probability Density Function\|PDF]]
- **Gaps**
    - There may be ranges of values within the data where no cases are recorded
- **Heaping**
    - some values may occur unexpectedly often
- **Rounding**
    - Only certain *round* values (like integers) are found
- **Errors/Impossibilities**

Different graphs emphasize different features.

## Combine Continuous Variables and Categorical Variables

When combining [[EDAV - Continuous Variable\|Continuous Variable]]s and [[EDAV - Categorical Data\|Categorical Variable]]s, we should consider

- mapping options:
    - Continuous: x-axis, y-axis, color (not so great), size (not so great)
    - Categorical: color, facets (rows, columns), shape (maybe)
- Add one variable at a time
- Create more graphs if suitable options run out
- Switch options to test
