# Density Curve

In [[Probability Theory\|Probability Theory]], a density curve is a function that describes how a random variable is distributed. It is a smooth curve that shows how often each value of the random variable occurs.

In [[EDAV\|EDAV]], a density curve for some data is the density curve of any distribution that approximates the data empirical distribution.
A common technique is to give each point a [[Normal Distribution\|Normal Distribution]] with mean equal to its value. Then the density curve is the **composition** of multiple normal distributions.

Then the variance of the normal distribution, which can be seen as **binwidth** in [[Histogram\|Histogram]], controls the shape of the curve.

- If the variance is too small, then the [[Normal Distribution\|Normal Distribution]] becomes a [[Dirac Distribution\|Dirac Distribution]], and the composite density curve becomes too sharp
- If the variance is too large, then the [[Normal Distribution\|Normal Distribution]] becomes a constant, and the composite density curve becomes too flat

In real implementations, such variance is controlled by parameter **bandwidth** `h`.

Sometimes due to the x-axis limits, the density curve doesn't go to zero at two ends (see the last graph above). We can expand the x-axis limits in such cases.
