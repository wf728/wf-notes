# Heatmap

How does a heatmap work:

Heatmaps can be seen as two-dimensional [[Histogram\|Histogram]]s. Therefore, [[Histogram#^e0e0f4\|bin width]] is also an important element for heatmaps.

In [[ggplot2\|ggplot2]], use `geom_bin2d()` to create a heatmap.

## Hex Heatmap

Rather than using squares, hex heatmaps use hexagons. Hexagons are more compact, provide more accurate information, and make more natural transitions. In [[ggplot2\|ggplot2]], use `geom_hex` to create hex heatmaps.

## Unfixed Shapes

When using unfixed shapes, we can think of heatmaps as colored [[Density Contour Plot\|Density Contour Plot]]s. This kind of heatmaps is widely used for geographic patterns and thermal patterns.

## Changing Colors

Colors in heatmaps show the magnitudes of the phenomenon (cluster). An example to change the color: `scale_fill_continuous(low = "grey", high = "purple")`

## Three Variables

The color can not only represent the magnitude of the cluster, but it can also represent a **third** variable. By doing this, heatmaps are no longer restricted to [[EDAV - Continuous Variable\|Continuous Variable]]s, but can also be for [[EDAV - Categorical Data\|categorical]].

For three variables, we cannot use `geom_bin2d` anymore. Some choices in [[ggplot2\|ggplot2]] are

- `geom_tile`: plots a dot as a tile, with specified width and height
    - use `color = white` to add white borders to the tiles
- `geom_rect`: plots a dot as a rectangle, with specified `xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax`
    - Rectangles can be squares with `coord_fixed()`
- `geom_raster`: same as `geom_tile` w/ uniform width and height, and is faster

The above functions only plot the tiles without colors. Use `aes(fill = z)` to fill the colors according to variable `z`.
